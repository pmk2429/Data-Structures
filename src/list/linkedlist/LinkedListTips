If you want to navigate to the curr being null node which is similar to do..while {}
while (curr != null) {
    curr = curr.next;
}

If want to move the `curr` pointer to the last element in the LinkedList
while (curr != null) {
    curr = curr.next;
}

If you want to move the `curr` pointer to 2 nodes before the end of the LinkedList
while (curr.next.next != null) {
    curr = curr.next;
}

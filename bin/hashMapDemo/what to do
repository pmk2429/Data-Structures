Make an abstract class LivingBeing

Extend this class to HumanBeing, and Animals. 

Read input from the file for each Entity i.e for HumanBeing and Animal.
Each line in the file corresponds to a specific entity be it HumanBeing or an Animal.

These entries should be stored in a DataStructure where it is easy to find each entry
and retrieve each entity by its name/type;

Questions:
1) Store all the records in a Data Structure.
2) find out whether the record is BONDER or not! If yes, find out the spouse name. and print both the names
3) Implement all the OOP features.
4) Implement LinkedList, ArrayList, Set, HashSet along with the HashMap in Java. 
5) The name of each of the record should be inserted and retrieved in O(1) time.
6) Calculate total number of pairs, total living beings, total humans and total animals.
7) Sort each living being and each animal in ascending order by age.

DS to implement with this project:
HashMap
LinkedList
ArrayList
